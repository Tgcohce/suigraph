## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

**Backend API Testing:**
- âœ… Complex contract analysis: 1 module, 3 functions, 9 vulnerabilities detected
- âœ… Suiscan integration: Mock contracts successfully processed
- âœ… Function nodes: Properly generated and linked to modules
- âœ… Vulnerability association: Security issues correctly mapped to specific functions

**Frontend Functionality:**
- âœ… Tabbed interface working
- âœ… Vulnerability panel displays detailed information
- âœ… Export functionality generates proper reports
- âœ… Graph shows both modules and functions
- âœ… Severity filtering and visual indicators

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Capabilities

**Current Detection Rules:**
- 8+ security vulnerability patterns
- Function-level risk assessment
- Module dependency analysis
- Code pattern recognition
- Confidence scoring for findings

**Output Formats:**
- Interactive web interface
- PDF reports (via browser print)
- Markdown documentation
- JSON data export

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The enhanced SuiGraph now provides:
1. **Professional Security Reports** with detailed findings and recommendations
2. **Complete Graph Visualization** showing all contract elements and relationships  
3. **Multiple Export Options** for sharing and documentation
4. **Advanced Filtering** for focusing on specific security concerns
5. **Scalable Architecture** ready for deployment to production environments

The system successfully addresses the original requirements:
- âœ… Shows modules AND functions in graph
